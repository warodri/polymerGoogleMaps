# polymerGoogleMaps

With Polymer I did a small script to embed a Google Maps map using one line of code.
```
<my-google-maps id="myPolymerMap" lat="39.469489" lng="-0.376214" zoom="13"></my-google-maps>
```              
This line will load google maps on the given coordinates and Zoom.

Check my working demo where you can see how to change coordinates by modifying this tag's attributes.
